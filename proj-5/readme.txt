Arduino Project #5

AIM: To manage/control my music client (ncmpcpp) using arduino 

Requirements:
An Arduino board (Dueminalove was used in the experiment)
LCD 16x2 (JHD162a used in the experiment)
ncmpcpp

Steps:

1. Make sure the lcd is attached to arduino board properly.
2. Upload the sketch to arduino board.
3. Run the bash and python scripts and start playing some music.
4. The current playing song should be displayed on the lcd.
5. Attach a wire from #8 digital pin to the breadboard and then put a resistance wire linked to it.
6. When you tap on the resistance wire, the song should change, and should be upaded on the lcd as well.
